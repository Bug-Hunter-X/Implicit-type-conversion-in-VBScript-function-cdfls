This repository contains a simple VBScript function that demonstrates a potential issue with implicit type conversion. The function is designed to return -1, 0, or 1 based on the input value. However, when called with a negative input value, the function returns a Boolean value of False instead of -1. This is due to the implicit type conversion performed by VBScript. The bugSolution.vbs file provides a solution to this problem by explicitly declaring the function's return type.
